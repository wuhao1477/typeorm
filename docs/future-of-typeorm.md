# The Future of TypeORM

> By [David Hoeck (@dlhck)](https://github.com/dlhck) and [Michael Bromley (@michaelbromley)](https://github.com/michaelbromley)


TypeORM is one of the most high-performance, feature-rich, and battle-tested ORMs in the Node.js ecosystem, relied upon by hundreds of thousands of projects and companies worldwide. With nearly 2 million downloads each week, it powers countless applications as a critical dependency. However, over the past few years, maintenance has slowed significantly, leading to growing uncertainty about the project’s future among its dedicated community.

We’re thrilled to announce that Michael Bromley and David Hoeck, under the umbrella of our parent company [Elevantiq](https://elevantiq.com/), are
stepping up to lead TypeORM into its next chapter. At Elevantiq, where we
specialize in enterprise digital commerce solutions, TypeORM is a critical dependency—not
only for [Vendure](https://vendure.io/), our flagship open-source project, but also for many of our other solutions.
With our reliance on TypeORM and the growing needs of its vibrant community, we saw an
opportunity to contribute back and ensure the project remains active, maintained, and secure.

After discussions with TypeORM’s original maintainers, Umed and Dmitry, we’ve reached an agreement to take on the project’s maintenance, inspired by successful, community-centric open-source projects. One standout model is [the Tauri project](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri), a self-governing open-source initiative co-founded by [Daniel](https://github.com/denjell-crabnebula), who we already collaborate with through Michael and Vendure. Our discussions with Tauri have set the foundation for the organizational structure we envision.

## Our Vision for TypeORM’s Future

To ensure long-term stability and governance, we plan to establish a non-profit
foundation for TypeORM, likely under the [Commons Conservancy](https://commonsconservancy.org/) in the Netherlands.
This foundation will be led by a board of seven members: Michael and David,
along with five additional board members dedicated to the project’s success.
The board will work closely with a **Working Group** comprising companies, contributors,
and other community members who heavily rely on TypeORM. This collaborative setup will help guide
strategic decisions that align with the needs and goals of TypeORM’s ecosystem.

## Organizational Structure

To drive TypeORM forward, we’ll introduce three core domains:

- **Development**: Led by core developers with expertise across various database engines and adapters, this team will focus on TypeORM’s architecture and ongoing technical maintenance and advancements.
- **Operations**: Handling day-to-day needs, from documentation to sponsorship accounting, this team will keep the project running smoothly.
- **Community**: Dedicated to engaging, moderating, and supporting our growing community, this team will foster collaboration through platforms like Discord.

## Scaling Sponsorships and Full-Time Development

A significant part of our strategy is to increase sponsorships, reaching out to
companies and collaborating with organizations like [OSS Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/). Our goal is to fund and
employ two full-time developers who will lead the Development team, ensuring ongoing progress
and project maintenance.

We’re confident that, with this structure, we can build a sustainable future for TypeORM. But the
_success of this vision depends on the support of the community_.
We’ll also remain in close contact with [Umed](https://github.com/pleerock) to keep his insights and vision connected to the project’s evolution.
